=IPC=
Inter Process Communication (IPC) allows applications to communicate with Everything under windows.

The Everything IPC allows applications to query and get search results from the "''Everything''" database.

You can only communicate with Everything from the local machine.

Use [[support/everything/ETP]] if you would like to communicate with Everything over a network.

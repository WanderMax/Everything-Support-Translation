==Examples==
Export all mp3 files to an Everything file list named mp3.efu
<pre>
es.exe *.mp3 -export-efu mp3.efu
</pre>

Show the top 10 largest files:
<pre>
es.exe -sort size -n 10
</pre>

Show the last 10 modified files:
<pre>
es.exe -sort dm -n 10
</pre>

Highlight the search terms foo bar
<pre>
es.exe foo bar -highlight
</pre>

Make ES show the size column, date modified column and set some pretty colors and make them the default settings:
<pre>
es.exe -size -dm -sizecolor 0x0d -dmcolor 0x0b -save-settings
</pre>

==Return Codes==
ES can return one of the following errorlevel codes:
{|

==Notes==
Dashes (-) inside switches can be omitted, for example, instead of using -no-digit-grouping, use: -nodigitgrouping

Switches can also start with a /

Use double quotes to escape spaces and switches.

Switches can be disabled by prefixing them with no-, eg: -no-size.

Use ^ to escape \, &, |, >, < and ^.

=DB=
This is very basic description and is likely to change...
Since the database is just a cache of the NTFS mft with some volume information, it can be re-built from scratch easily.

BZIP compression can be applied.
I usually see a total 11:1 compression ratio.
After BZIP decompression it should look something like:

Followed immediately by the monitoring status for each volume.

There are 26 of the following structures, one for each drive:

Followed immediately by the exclude list count:

{|

Followed immediately by the exclude list:
Use the exclude list count from above to determine how many exclude items there are..

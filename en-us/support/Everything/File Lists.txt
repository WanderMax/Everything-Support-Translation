=File Lists=
An EFU file is a Comma-separated Values (CSV) file containing a list of filenames, sizes, dates and attributes.
File lists can be opened with Everything or included in your Everything index.
File lists can be searched and sorted by size, date or attributes instantly.

==How do I make an EFU File list from the command line?==
To create a file list from the command line:
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-filelist <output-filename> <path-to-scan>
</pre>

Combine with [[support/everything/command_line_options#-create-file-list-exclude-files|-create-file-list-exclude-files]] <filters> to exclude files.
Combine with [[support/everything/command_line_options#-create-file-list-exclude-folders|-create-file-list-exclude-folders]] <filters> to exclude folders.
Combine with [[support/everything/command_line_options#-create-file-list-include-only-files|-create-file-list-include-only-files]] <filters> to include only the specified files.

Examples
To create a file list excluding tmp files:
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-file-list "myfilelist.efu" "c:\" -create-file-list-exclude-files "*.tmp"
</pre>

To create a file list excluding lnk and thumbs.db files:
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-file-list "myfilelist.efu" "c:\" -create-file-list-exclude-files "*.lnk;thumbs.db"
</pre>

To exclude folders with the name 1033:
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-file-list "myfilelist.efu" "c:\" -create-file-list-exclude-folders "1033"
</pre>

To exclude a specific folder
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-file-list "myfilelist.efu" "c:\" -create-file-list-exclude-folders "c:\windows"
</pre>

To exclude specific folders
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-file-list "myfilelist.efu" "c:\" -create-file-list-exclude-folders "c:\windows;c:\program files;c:\program files (x86)"
</pre>

To include specified files only:
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-file-list "myfilelist.efu" "c:\" -create-file-list-include-only-files "*.mp3;*.flac"
</pre>

regex can be used in the exclude lists, for example, exclude files starting with A-M
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-file-list "myfilelist.efu" "c:\" -create-file-list-exclude-files "regex:^^[A-M]"
</pre>

Path matching can be done by including a \ in your filter (\\ for regex).
<pre>
Everything.exe -create-file-list "myfilelist.efu" "c:\" -create-file-list-exclude-files "c:\folder\a specific file.txt"
</pre>

==Does Everything access the files in the file list?==

</ul>

==Can I use relative paths in a file list?==

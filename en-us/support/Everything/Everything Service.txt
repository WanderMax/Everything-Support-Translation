=Everything Service=
The Everything service indexes NTFS volumes and monitors USN Journals.
This allows the Everything client to run as a standard user.

On XP or earlier the Everything service is not required.
On Vista or later with a standard user account you will need to install the Everything service to use NTFS indexing.
On Vista or later with the true administrator account the Everything service is not required.

The Everything service is installed by default on Windows Vista or later when the installer is run with a standard user account.

=Recent Changes=
Recent changes is a list of files and folders that have been changed since Everything was started.

==Search recent changes==
Use rc: or recentchange: with a date to search for recent changes:
<pre>
rc:<date>
</pre>

For example, to find recent changes today, search for:
<pre>
rc:today
</pre>

For example, to find recent changes yesterday, search for:
<pre>
rc:yesterday
</pre>

For example, to find recent changes in the last 2 hours, search for:
<pre>
rc:last2hours
</pre>

For example, to find recent changes in the last 10 minutes, search for:
<pre>
rc:last10mins
</pre>

For the full rc: search syntax, please see [[support/everything/searching#Functions|searching]].

==Include the USN Journal in the recent changes list==
By default, Everything will only keep a list of changes since Everything was started, including the USN change Journal in the recent changes list will allow you to quickly search for changes that can go back many days.

To include the USN Journals in the recent changes list:
<ul>
*In "'''''Everything'''''", from the '''Tools''' menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''NTFS''' tab.
*For each local NTFS volume:
<ul>
*Check '''Include USN Journal in recent changes'''.
</ul>
*Click '''OK'''.
</ul>

==Sort by recent changes==
Sorting by recent changes is instant and persistant.
Right click an empty spot in the result list, from the Sort by menu, click Date Recently changed.
Sort by recent changes to monitor changes to the Everything index in real-time.

=Folder Indexing=
Folder indexing allows Everything to include any file system folder in the Everything index.

Indexed folders can go offline and remain in the Everything index.

For example, with folder indexing you can index:
<ul>
*Network shares or mapped network drives.
*FAT32 and other volumes.
*Any physical folder.
</ul>

==Do I need administrative privileges or the Everything service to index folders?==
No, folder indexing does not require administrative privileges or the Everything service.

==Why is indexing so slow?==
Folder indexing uses the same approach as the Windows search.
This can be a lot slower than NTFS indexing.
Everything can take a couple minutes to scan a folder and all its subfolders and files.

==How do I add a folder to the Everything index?==
<ul>
*In '''Everything''', from the '''Tools '''menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''Folders '''tab.
*Click '''Add...'''.
*Select a folder to add to the Everything index.
*Click '''OK'''.
*Click '''OK'''.
</ul>

==How do I add a network share to the Everything index?==
<ul>
*In '''Everything''', from the '''Tools '''menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''Folders '''tab.
*Click '''Add...'''.
*Select the network share to add to the Everything index, for example:
<pre>
\\server\share
</pre>
*Click '''OK'''.
*Click '''OK'''.
</ul>

==How do I add a mapped network drive to the Everything index?==
<ul>
*In '''Everything''', from the '''Tools '''menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''Folders '''tab.
*Click '''Add...'''.
*Select the mapped network drive.
*Click '''OK'''.
*Click '''OK'''.
</ul>

==How do I stop Everything from scanning folders on startup==
To prevent Everything from rescanning folders on startup:
<ul>
*In '''Everything''', type in the following search and press '''ENTER''':
/[[support/everything/ini#folder_update_rescan_asap|folder_update_rescan_asap]]=0
</ul>

Folder rescanning will occur at the next scheduled time.

==Will Everything detect all file name changes made to this folder?==
Almost all changes are detected. 
Changes can be missed if too many occur in a short time.

To rebuild the folder index when too many changes occur in a short time:
<ul>
*In '''Everything''', from the '''Tools '''menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''Folders '''tab.
*Select a folder.
*Check '''Rescan on full buffer'''.
</ul>

Everything can schedule an update time or update interval to rescan the entire folder for changes that might have been missed.

To customize the update time or update interval:
<ul>
*In '''Everything''', from the '''Tools '''menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''Folders '''tab.
*Select a folder.
*Choose one of the options below:
<ul>
*Update each day, or weekly on a specific day, at a specific time.
*Update periodically in the specified hours or minutes.
*Never update.
</ul>
</ul>

==How do I manually update a folder index?==
To manually update all folder indexes:
<ul>
*In '''Everything''', from the '''Tools '''menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''Folders '''tab.
*Click '''Rescan All Now'''.
*Click '''OK'''.
</ul>

To manually update a folder index:
<ul>
*In '''Everything''', from the '''Tools '''menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''Folders '''tab.
*Select the folder to update and click '''Rescan Now'''.
*Click '''OK'''.
</ul>

==What happens if the indexed folder is offline or not available?==
The folder index will remain unchanged.
However, forcing a index rebuild will show the folder as empty.

Everything will continue to re-scan the folder at the specified update time or update interval and only update the folder when it is online.

Displaying icons and file information of offline folders can take several seconds to time-out.
You can press F5 to refresh this cache when the folder is back online.

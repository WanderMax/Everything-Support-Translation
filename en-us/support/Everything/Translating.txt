=Translating=
Please check [[support/Everything/Supported languages]] for a list of supported translations.

Download the English translation template from [[/Template.zip]]

Unzip the template to an empty folder.

Open the file <code>Template.txt</code> with notepad.

Translate each string in the template to the new language.

==Syntax==
Each string will appear on a single line and has the following syntax:
<pre>
key = "value"
</pre>

For example: the string in the English translation template:
<pre>
LOADING_DATABASE = "Loading database..."
</pre>

For example: Translating the LOADING_DATABASE string to Italian:
<pre>
LOADING_DATABASE = "Caricamento della base dati..."
</pre>

==Comments==
<code>//</code> Start a line comment (the rest of the line is ignored)
<code>;</code> Start a line comment (the rest of the line is ignored)
Comments are ignored by the language compiler.

==Escaping charactors==
{|
! Escape
! Description
|-
| <code>\n</code>
| new line
|-
| <code>\r</code>
| line return
|-
| <code>\t</code>
| tab
|-
| <code>\"</code>
| escape a double quote (")
|-
| <code>\\</code>

==printf==
{| style="background:#ffeeee; border:1px dashed red;"
| %s and %d must be in the same order as they appear in the English translation template.
|}

==Menu Keys==
place a <code>&</code> in front of the letter for the menu key.
This only apples to strings in the English translation template that have a <code>&</code>

==Saving==
Please save the template as UTF-8

==Updating==

I will notify you by email when translations require updating.

An up to date English translation template is always available from [[/Template.zip]]

New and changed translation strings are added to the end of the template.

If you have an existing translation you will need to add the updated translations from [[/Template.zip]] to the end of your translation template.

Your translation is compatible with previous and future versions of Everything.
Strings that have not yet been translated will appear in English.


==Changes==
Some strings may change vary between Everything versions. Usually help information is expanded upon or alt shortcut keys added.
Please check the Changes.txt in the [[/Template.zip]] file for a list of changes that may need updating in your existing translation template.txt.

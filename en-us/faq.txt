=Everything=
=="Everything" 是什么？==
"Everything" 是 Windows 上一款搜索引擎，它能够基于文件名快速定文件和文件夹位置。
不像 Windows 内置搜索，"Everything" 默认显示电脑上每个文件和文件夹 (就如其名 "Everything")。
您在搜索框输入的关键词将会筛选显示的文件和文件夹。

==索引全部文件需要多长时间？==
"Everything" 仅索引文件和文件夹名，一般仅需几秒便可建立其数据库。
全新安装的 Windows 10 (大约 120,000 个文件) 仅需 1 秒即可索引完成。
索引 1,000,000 个文件将需要大约 1 分钟。

==Everything 能否搜索文件内容？==
可以，"Everything" 可以通过搜索函数 content: 来搜索文件内容。
文件内容未被索引时，搜索内容将会很慢。

=="Everything" 是否占用很多系统资源？==
不，"Everything" 仅需要使用非常少的系统资源。
全新安装的 Windows 10 (大约 120,000 个文件) 仅需要大约 14 MB 的内存以及不到 9 MB 的硬盘空间。
1,000,000 个文件需要大约 75 MB 的内存和 45 MB 的硬盘空间。

=="Everything" 能都监控文件系统变更？==
可以，"Everything" 可以监控文件系统变更。
Your search windows will reflect changes made to the file system.

=="Everything" 免费么？==
免费，"Everything" 是一款免费软件。
软件开发维护不易，请考虑[[donate|捐赠]].

=="Everything" 是否包含恶意、间谍软件或广告？==
完全没有，"Everything" 不包含任何恶意、间谍软件或广告。

==Does "Everything" miss changes made to the file system if it is not running?==
No, "Everything" can be closed and restarted without missing changes made to the file system (even across system restarts).
"Everything" updates the database when it is started.

==What are the system requirements for "Everything"?==
"Everything" will run on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10
NTFS indexing requires the Everything service or running "Everything" as administrator.

==How do I convert a volume to NTFS?==
Please backup anything important before converting a volume to NTFS.
Once a volume is converted to NTFS it can not be converted back to FAT or FAT32.
Please note that some devices may not be able to read NTFS volumes on USB disks / USB drives.

To convert a volume to NTFS:
<ul>
*From the '''Start''' menu, click '''Run'''.
*Type in the following and press '''ENTER''':
<pre>
cmd
</pre>
*In the command prompt, type in the following and press '''ENTER''':
<pre>
convert D: /fs:ntfs
</pre>
''where D: is the drive to convert.''
</ul>

==Can "Everything" index a mapped network drive?==
Yes, please see [[support/everything/folder indexing#how_do_i_add_a_network_share_to_the_everything_index|Folder indexing]] for more information.

==How do I install "Everything"?==
Please see A [[support/everything/installing everything|basic guide to installing "Everything"]].

==How do I use "Everything"?==
Please see A [[support/everything/using everything|basic guide to using "Everything"]].

==Why is "Everything" 1.4 using more memory than 1.3?==
"Everything" 1.4 indexes file sizes and dates and also stores extra information for faster sorting by default.
Please see [[support/everything/indexes#optimizing_for_smallest_memory_foot_print|Optimizing for smallest memory foot print]] to disable these changes.

==How do I prevent the UAC prompt when running "Everything"?==
"Everything" requires administrative privileges for low level read access to NTFS volumes for NTFS indexing.

The UAC prompt can be avoided by running "Everything" as a standard user and installing the "Everything" service or not using NTFS indexing.

To run "Everything" as a standard user and install the "Everything" service:
<ul>
*In '''''"Everything"''''', from the '''Tools''' menu, click '''Options'''.
*Click the '''General''' tab.
*Check '''Everything Service'''.
*Uncheck '''Run as administrator'''.
*Click '''OK'''.
*Exit "Everything" (right click the Everything system tray icon and click Exit)
*Restart Everything.
</ul>



=Searching=

==How do I search for a file or folder?==
Type the partial file or folder name into the search edit, the results will appear instantly.

==How do I use boolean operators?==
'''AND''' is the default boolean operator.

For example, to search for abc and 123, search for:
<pre>
abc 123
</pre>

To search for either of two search terms, add a | between the terms.

For example, to search for .jpg or .bmp, search for:
<pre>
.jpg | .bmp
</pre>

To exclude something from the search include a ! at the front of the term.

For example, to search for everything except abc, search for:
<pre>
!abc
</pre>

To show the basic search syntax in Everything:
<ul>
In '''''"Everything"''''', from the '''Help''' menu, click '''Search syntax'''.
</ul>

==How do I use wildcards?==
Using a * in your search will match any number of any type of character.
For example, here is how to search for files and folders that start with e and end with g: e*g
Using a ? in your search will match one character.
For example, here is how to search for files that have a 2 letter file extension: *.??

==How do I include spaces in my search?==
To include spaces in your search enclose your search in double quotes.
For example, here is how to search for foo<space>bar: "foo bar"

==How do I search for a file type?==
To search for a file type, type the file extension into the search edit,
eg: to search for the mp3 file type, type *.mp3 into the search edit.
To search for more than one type of file type use a | to separate file types,
eg: *.bmp|*.jpg will search for files with the extension bmp or jpg.

==How do I search for files and folders in a specific location?==
To search for files and folders in a specific location include a \ in your search string.
For example, here is how to search for all your mp3s in a downloads folder: downloads\ .mp3
You could alternately enable Match Path in the Search menu and include the location in your search string.
For example, here is how to search for all your avis in a downloads folder with Match Path enabled: downloads .avi

==Advanced searching==

*Click OK.
</ul>

==Duplicated results==
NTFS volumes are automatically indexed by "Everything".
Adding a NTFS volume as a folder index will show duplicated results.

Please remove any NTFS volumes from the folder index:
<ul>
*In Everything, from the Tools menu, click Options.
*Click the Folders tab.
*Select any NTFS volumes and click Remove.
*Click OK.
</ul>

To check which NTFS volumes are automatically included:
<ul>
*In Everything, from the Tools menu, click Options.
*Click the NTFS tab.
*NTFS volumes that have Include in database checked are included in the NTFS index.
</ul>

==The result list is empty or contains only drives==
Please make sure the "Everything" service is running or "Everything" is running as administrator.

To install the "Everything" service:
<ul>
*In Everything, from the Tools menu, click Options.
